Sorting for three numbers ex: 123 321 312 212 231 132 

If the index of the fist number is the highest, to ra:
	• ra = shift all elements of stack a by 1
Otherwise, if the index of the second nuymber is highest, do rra:
	• rra = shift down all elements of stack by 1, last element becomes the first
Then if index of the first number is bigger than the index of the second number,
do sa:
	• sa = swap fist two elements at top of stack a 
Stack B is not yet used here ^


Sorting algorithm for more than three numbers:

will have 8 steps:
	• pb = push to b all elements from stack a except for 3
	• sort the 3 numbers left like above ^ in stack a
	• loop as long as there are elements in stack b 
		- fund current position of every element in stack a and b 
		- calulate target position in stack a where each element in stack b 
		should be
		- calculate the number of actions (the cost) to put each eleemnet in Stack
		B as its target position in stack A and choose the element that's cheapes tto move
		- execute the sequence of actions needed to move teh element from stack B to Stack
	• if stack A is not sorted, chose between ra and rra to rotate it into ascending order
